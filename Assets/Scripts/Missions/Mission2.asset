  mission_description: "A while ago, Cycorp staged a night raid on one of our hideouts.
    Most of everyone got out safely, but we've left behind a valauble supply depot.
    If we're to make any ground in our merry little uprising, we're gonna need to
    recover those supplies. \n\nThere's been reports of high activity in the area
    - seems like they're expecting our crackback. The team needs to get in, clear
    any resistance, and get out fast. "
