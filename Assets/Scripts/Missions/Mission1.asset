  mission_description: "\tWe recently got get a hold of some of Cycorp's experimental
    training software. Don't know what those freaks were thinking, but they managed
    to make everything feel real - including the pain. \n\n\tI reckon it's a good
    way to refresh yourself on the basics of command, plus our green-eyed operatives
    can safely get a taste of the action. "
